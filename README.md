## Important tips

* Do not insist on staying  with a currency. Sometimes you have to abandon it for something better.
* If you lost a lot on a currency and it is taking a lot of time and nothing happens, leave it  for something that can make it up to you in a shorter time.
* If you know why you bought a currency and you know the stoploss and profit limits, don't pay attention to the oscilations in between.
