## Trading Psychology

* Do not insist on staying  with a currency. Sometimes you have to abandon it for something better.
* If you lost a lot on a currency and it is taking a lot of time and nothing happens, leave it  for something that can make it up to you in a shorter time.
* If you know why you bought a currency and you know the stoploss and profit limits, don't pay attention to the oscilations in between.
* **Attention** It's important to save your profits in every resistance you recognize. Thats when you want to stay longer with the currency. Otherwise, get ride of it all in the resistance based on the sircumstances.
* REMEMBER: We only have to do what the market makes available. 
* Set your goals to what you CAN control.
* If you have a bad trade in one day, do not continue trading in that day. Because you are ganna make more and more mistakes.
* REMEMBER: Untill you are still in a trade, you've not profit or lost yet. So what ever the price is showing, is still not yours untill the trade is closed.
 


## Trading strategy

* When we are still a new trader and we don't have enough money not to use leverage, we stick with the low frameworks like 15 mins and 30 mins or even less. That is calles scalp trading.
* You can put your take profit line in the safest spot in order to reduce the risk.
* Always wait for the setup to confirm. That is very important.
* Remember till the process is still open, you haven't lost or gain anything yet. 
* When you have placed the stoploss and take profit, constantly looking at the trend doesn't help and it sometimes makes you act in the wrong place.
* You can use other timeframes to determine your stops and profit taking. Do not always stick to the final destination. You are supposed to move with the resistance and support lines defined either by fibbonachi or ichimoku or both.
* You don't need to trade every day. It's a fact that some days there are not appropriate frames to tade. NO TRADING is better than getting stopped over and over again.


## Fast Scalp Trading

* The strategy is to take small profits in short times (scale of short times is from a min to at most 10 to 15 mins).
* In this strategy, the only instrument is the price action and the candels.
* It is better to trade only in time of Newyork-London overlap (golden time: When important banks come into play) and do not trade more than 3 to 4 trades a day in the beggining.
* The close price from the day before is an imprtant area to consider for the day.
* The area in which the price was ranging in the Tokyo-Syndy overlap is another important area that the price might have reactions to these areas over and over again.
* As a fast scalp trader, you might get more signals from 1m chart but you have to check 5m and maybe 15m sometimes as well. But remember more than 5m charts are not for getting signals in this strategy.
* News are not really taken into account in this stratagy. 
* It is important to mark the time periods by vertical lines (You can seet it in the chart settings as period separation).
* The perivious days close prise is an important area of price action. 
* In this particular strategy, sometimes even if the chart is only ranging between two areas, we can trade the range.
* One of the keys to get buy and sell signals are **Candels** in this strategy. We have to include a locally bigger candel as a **Watch Cnadel** then wait for the next candel to send a signal as a **Signal Candel** then we have to wait for one other candel to confirm the trend and we can enter the market based on the situation. 
* The next step is to place stop-loss and take-profit. Make some changes to Fibbo Retracement as it follows:
  * Delete all the Fibbo numbers. We won't need them. Replace the first line with SL (Stop Loss).
  * Replace second line with EN (Enter).
  * Replace the next lines with TP1, TP2,..., TP7 (Normally not more than 7 Take Profits. Its up to you).
  * place the entry point and continue the mouse to put the stop (normally end of the signal candel). 
  * Wait for the profits (close manually). It is completely base on the situation. Sometimes you get 7 and sometimes even 3 or less.

* **THREE POINT TOUCH**: When you see the chart reacted three times to the same area or line, you probably should be expecting a rally afterwards. You can profit from this point.
