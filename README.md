## Important tips

* Do not insist on staying  with a currency. Sometimes you have to abandon it for something better.
* If you lost a lot on a currency and it is taking a lot of time and nothing happens, leave it  for something that can make it up to you in a shorter time.
* If you know why you bought a currency and you know the stoploss and profit limits, don't pay attention to the oscilations in between.
* **Attention** It's important to save your profits in every resistance you recognize. Thats when you want to stay longer with the currency. Otherwise, get ride of it all in the resistance based on the sircumstances.

## Trading strategy

* When we are still a new trader and we don't have enough money not to usee leverage, we stick with the low frameworks like 15 mins and 30 mins or even less. That is calles scalp trading.
* You can put your take profit line in the safest spot in order to reduce the risk.
* Always wait for the setup to confirm. That is very important.
