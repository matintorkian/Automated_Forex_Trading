## Trading Psychology

* Do not insist on staying  with a currency. Sometimes you have to abandon it for something better.
* If you lost a lot on a currency and it is taking a lot of time and nothing happens, leave it  for something that can make it up to you in a shorter time.
* If you know why you bought a currency and you know the stoploss and profit limits, don't pay attention to the oscilations in between.
* **Attention** It's important to save your profits in every resistance you recognize. Thats when you want to stay longer with the currency. Otherwise, get ride of it all in the resistance based on the sircumstances.
* REMEMBER: We only have to do what the market makes available. 
* Set your goals to what you CAN control.
* If you have a bad trade in one day, do not continue trading in that day. Because you are ganna make more and more mistakes.
* REMEMBER: Untill you are still in a trade, you've not profit or lost yet. So what ever the price is showing, is still not yours untill the trade is closed.
 


## Trading strategy

* When we are still a new trader and we don't have enough money not to use leverage, we stick with the low frameworks like 15 mins and 30 mins or even less. That is calles scalp trading.
* You can put your take profit line in the safest spot in order to reduce the risk.
* Always wait for the setup to confirm. That is very important.
* Remember till the process is still open, you haven't lost or gain anything yet. 
* When you have placed the stoploss and take profit, constantly looking at the trend doesn't help and it sometimes makes you act in the wrong place.
* You can use other timeframes to determine your stops and profit taking. Do not always stick to the final destination. You are supposed to move with the resistance and support lines defined either by fibbonachi or ichimoku or both.
* You don't need to trade every day. It's a fact that some days there are not appropriate frames to tade. NO TRADING is better than getting stopped over and over again.
