%
% PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

% Usage: \makeheading{name}
% OR
% \makeheading[right_object]{name}
%
% Place at top of document. It should be the first thing.
% If ``right_object'' is provided in the square-braced optional
% argument, it will be right justified on the same line as ``name'' at
% the top of the CV. For example:
%
% \makeheading[\emph{Curriculum vitae}]{Your Name}
%
% will put an emphasized ``Curriculum vitae'' at the top of the document
% as a title. Likewise, a picture could be included:
%
% \makeheading[\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{my_picutre}]{Your Name}

\section{DivIch trading setup}

First of all, you need to find a divergence setup in a time frame that you are comfortable with trading in (based on beinf a scalp trader or a swing trader). 

\subsection{Finding divergence setup}
After finding the suitable divergence setup, we have to chose a target. Choosing the target is again based on the fact that you are a scalp or swing trader. Normally, the height between the diverged points is a trust worthy target. 
 




\subsection{Entering a trade}
After finding the suitalble divergence setup, checkout the Ichimoku indicator. Whenever you get the buy signal from the Ichimoku indicator, you have to wait for the signal to confirm. That works by waiting for the candel to to be closed above the signal area and after that you have to calculate your reward to risk based on the arranged target and then if everything looks fine, you can enter the market. If you can constantly watch the trade, you can wait for Ichimoku to give you a sell signal and sell whenever it confirms. In this case, you can wach the trade again and wait for another buy signal confirmed with Ichimoku and in this way you can go for the main target and you may gain more that going staight to the target.
